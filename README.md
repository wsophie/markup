# Markup

May 2016

An easy to understand markup language for creating educational worksheets, along with an accompanying respository of community rated sheets.

## Introduction

After getting annoyed with the quality of many of the maths worksheets my kids were bringing home from school I decided that I would like to try and do something about it.

Since I love markup languages I decided to come up with a markup language specifically for creating worksheets.

On top of this I would then like to create a single online repository so anyone in the world can contribute, update, rate and download any sheets they want.

## What is needed?

* Definition of the syntax
* Software to turn markup into printable sheets
* Website to host things
* Understanding of the which topics need covering (in the UK we have the Key Stage specs to base things on, not sure about other countries)

## Where are we at the moment?

I have a basic syntax figured out, a basic markup to HTML processor written in ruby and a couple of sample sheets.

## But this repo is empty!

Er yes, I wanted to tidy up the code and specs before my initial upload.

## What next?

Progress!  :)
